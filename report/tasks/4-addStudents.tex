\chapter{Add Students Script}
The add students script opens a form for the user to fill up with the details for the new student, and, when submited, the form is checked by the same script and, when everything is correct, adds the new student to the database and redirects the user to the students page, and, if not, reopens the form with alerts displaying the data that was missing underneath the form inputs.

The form is a template that is loaded and uses global data to know if the alerts are to be displayed or not.
