\chapter{Key Security Concerns about Personal Data}

There are many risks and issues that can arise when it comes to the security of personal data retained from people that use computerized systems, especially if they are stored on a remote server.

The \cite{OWASP_Top_10} group has conducted a project to evaluate which are the top ten risks in Web Application Security and those are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Injection
  \item Broken Authentication
  \item Sensitive Data Exposure
  \item XML External Entities
  \item Broken Access Control
  \item Security Misconfiguration
  \item Cross-Site Scripting
  \item Insecure Deserialization
  \item Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
  \item Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
\end{enumerate}

Out of these, many of them have easy and well-known remediations and ways to be prevented, so it can only lead to the conclusion that many developers tend to overlook these security measures.

Looking into the Proactive Controls project done by the \cite{ProactiveControls}, the following security concepts should be in the front of every developer's mind when developing a system:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Verify for Security Early and Often
  \item Parameterize Queries
  \item Encode Data
  \item Validate All Inputs
  \item Implement Identity and Authentication Controls
  \item Implement Appropriate Access Controls
  \item Protect Data
  \item implement Logging and Intrusion Detection
  \item Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries
  \item Error Handling and Exception Handling
\end{enumerate}
