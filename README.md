# BNU OSS CW2

Work and report to be submitted for my Coursework 2 for the Open Source Systems module at Buckinghamshire New University.

The source code for this project is based on the [bnu-php-example](https://github.com/iamjonjackson/bnu-php-example) repository made by my lecturer.

## Installation Instructions

1. Run the SQL commands on your database from `src/_sql/college.dump` to setup the database tables and initial data
2. Download a copy of the repository files in the `src` folder to your server (in its own folder if you so wish)
3. Update `src/_includes/dbconnect.inc` with your database login credentials

## Work Done (Or To Be Done)

1. Add three new modules to the module table through phpMyAdmin
2. Create a new script to display all the student records
3. Display the student data inside a table
4. Add a new column in the table for each record to allow the selection of records
5. Add a delete button and update the script so that the selected records are deleted
6. Create a script that allows the creation of new students
7. Create UI/UX for the system using current technologies (HTML/CSS standards or frameworks)
8. Protect the SQL queries against SQL Injection
9. Research: Critically evaluate alternative server-side PHP and ASP.NET
10. Research: Give an account of key security concerns that should be considered by developers of systems for managing personal data
